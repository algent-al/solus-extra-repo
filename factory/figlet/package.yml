summary     : FIGlet - display large characters made up of ordinary screen characters
description : |
    FIGlet  prints its input using large characters (called "FIGcharacters") made up of ordinary screen characters (called "sub-characters"). FIGlet output is generally reminiscent of the sort of "signatures" many people like to  put  at the  end  of  e-mail and UseNet messages. It is also reminiscent of the output of some banner programs, although it is oriented normally, not sideways.
