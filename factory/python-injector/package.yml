summary    : Python dependency injection framework, inspired by Guice
description: |
    While dependency injection is easy to do in Python due to its support for keyword arguments, the ease with which objects can be mocked and its dynamic nature, a framework for assisting in this process can remove a lot of boiler-plate from larger applications. That's where Injector can help. It automatically and transitively provides dependencies for you.
